        <h1>Dog & Cat Food Recall FAQs (2025) – People Also Asked</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Stay informed about the latest dog and cat food recalls to ensure your pet’s safety. Below are answers to common questions about pet food safety, updated as of April 20, 2025.</p>

        <div class="question-block">
            <h2>What dog food was recently recalled?</h2>
            <p><strong>Dog food recently recalled</strong> was Blue Ridge Beef raw dog food due to salmonella risks. The FDA identified contamination in March 2025, prompting a voluntary recall. Affected products were sold in southeastern U.S. states. Pet owners should act quickly to ensure safety.</p>
            <p>In March 2025, Blue Ridge Beef voluntarily recalled multiple lots of their raw dog food, including "Beef for Dogs" and "Puppy Mix," after FDA testing confirmed salmonella contamination. Distributed primarily in Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, these products were sold frozen in clear plastic packaging. Salmonella can cause severe symptoms in dogs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and lethargy, and poses risks to humans handling the food, especially those with weakened immune systems. No pet or human illnesses were reported at the time of the recall, but the FDA urged immediate action to prevent health risks. Pet owners should dispose of the affected products securely in a sealed bag to avoid accidental consumption by pets or wildlife. Surfaces, bowls, and containers that contacted the food must be thoroughly sanitized using hot water and pet-safe disinfectants. The recall was triggered by routine FDA sampling, which detected salmonella in several product samples. Blue Ridge Beef provided a customer service hotline for inquiries and offered refunds for returned products. Raw dog food is particularly prone to bacterial contamination due to minimal processing, making vigilance essential. Pet owners are advised to regularly check the FDA’s pet food recall database for updates. Subscribing to services like PetAlertPro ensures instant alerts, helping you stay proactive and protect your pet and family from potential health hazards. <a href="../index.html#subscribe-now" class="subscribe-btn">🚀 Get Alerts Now</a></p>

            <p>In February 2025, Walmart, in collaboration with Mars Petcare, announced a recall of certain 44-pound bags of Pedigree Adult Complete Nutrition Grilled Steak & Vegetable Flavor Dry Dog Food, sold in stores across Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas. The recall was initiated due to the potential presence of metal fragments, which could cause choking or internal injuries in pets. No pet injuries or illnesses were reported at the time of the recall, but the companies acted preemptively to ensure consumer safety. The FDA published specific lot codes and best-by dates in its recall notice, advising pet owners to verify their product against this information. Customers were instructed to return affected products to Walmart for a full refund, no receipt required. The FDA classified this as a Class II recall, indicating a moderate health risk. Pet owners should immediately stop feeding the recalled product and monitor their dogs for symptoms like difficulty swallowing or unusual behavior. Sanitizing bowls and surfaces that may have contacted the food is recommended to prevent contamination. This incident highlights the importance of quality control in pet food manufacturing, as errors can occur during processing or packaging. Regular monitoring of FDA recall notices is crucial for pet safety. PetAlertPro offers automated alerts to help you act quickly and protect your dog from such risks. Retaining lot codes from pet food packaging facilitates swift verification against recall notices.</p>

The recall was prompted by the discovery of possible metal fragments in the product, which could lead to choking hazards or internal injuries in dogs. No adverse events were reported at the time of the recall, but Mars Petcare acted swiftly to protect pet safety. The FDA provided detailed lot codes and best-by dates in its recall notice, urging pet owners to verify their product against this information.

This incident was classified as a Class II recall by the FDA, indicating a moderate health risk.

            <p><strong>No. There is no recall on Rachael Ray dog food.</strong> Rachael Ray dog food recall status indicates no active recalls for Rachael Ray Nutrish products. As of April 20, 2025, FDA records show no issues. Pet owners should still verify lot codes.</p>

Smucker), per the FDA’s pet food recall database. The brand has maintained a relatively clean safety record, though it faced a voluntary recall in 2015 for elevated Vitamin D levels in certain cat food products, not dog food. Pet owners should remain proactive, as pet food recalls can arise unexpectedly due to risks like salmonella, listeria, or manufacturing errors. To ensure your Nutrish product is safe, compare the lot codes and best-by dates on the packaging with FDA recall announcements. If you notice unusual packaging, odor, or texture, refrain from feeding it and contact the manufacturer. Regular monitoring of FDA updates or subscribing to services like PetAlertPro can help you stay ahead of potential issues. While Rachael Ray Nutrish emphasizes natural ingredients, no pet food brand is entirely immune to recalls. Pet owners should sanitize feeding areas and store packaging for reference. If your dog shows symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, or lethargy after eating, consult a veterinarian immediately and report to the FDA.
