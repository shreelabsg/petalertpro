    <p>Dry cat food, like Purina One or Hill’s Science Diet, is formulated to be safe and balanced, but its low moisture content may not be ideal for cats prone to urinary issues, as wet food promotes hydration. Some cats may also have sensitivities to specific ingredients in dry food, such as grains or proteins.

    <p><strong>Your cat may have gone off his food</strong> if he shows reduced appetite or avoids meals, but a vet can confirm the cause.</p>
    <p>A cat refusing food, such as Purina Pro Plan or Sheba, could be due to boredom with the same flavor, stress, or an underlying health issue.
